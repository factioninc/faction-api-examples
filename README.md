# Faction Public API Examples

Welcome to the Faction Public API Examples repository!  This repository is for Faction customers to try out our Public APIs using the provided Python scripts and their Faction credentials.  More information and the examples can be found in the **examples** directory.

We also provide the OpenAPI 3.0 spec file that we use to create our Public APIs.  That spec file can be found in the **schema** directory
